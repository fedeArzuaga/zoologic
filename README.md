# Zoo Exercise

This is an exercise I've done implementing classes and OOP.

## I got it! How can I run it?

1. This was done using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), therefore you'll need to download and install it on your device.
2. Then, you can download or clone this repository and locate it where you want.
3. Finally, open your terminal (or command line, if you're using Windows), go to the project's folder and run the following command: ``node index.js``

That's it! You're going to be able to execute this program with node.

Feel free to use, clone or even fork if you find this script useful.
